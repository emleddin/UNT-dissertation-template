%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Modifying amsbook.cls
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%
%%% The following supersedes the amsbook.cls class file.
%%%
%%%
%%% Page Dimensions
%%%
%%% \voffset shifts the whole ``page'' up (negative) or down (positive) on
%%% the paper.
%%%
%%% \topmargin is the distance from 1'' down on the page (assuming
%%% \voffset=0pt) and the top of the headline.
%%%
%%% \headheight is the height of the headline above its baseline
%%%
%%% \headsep is the distance from the baseline of the headline to the top of
%%% the page body.
%%%
%%% The first baseline for a line on the page body is: 1'' + \topmargin +
%%% \headheight + \headsep + point size (12pt)
%%%
%%% \textheight is the goal distance from the top of the first line of text
%%% to the baseline of the last line of text.
%%%
%%% If TeX can't get a baseline exactly \texheight from the top of the first
%%% line of text, the first line stays put and space is added
%%% ``more-or-less'' evenly between each line of text on the page.
%%%
%%% \footsep is the distance from the bottom of the body of the text on the
%%% page to the baseline of the footline.
%%%
%%% To get page numbers .5in from the bottom of the page for 8 1/2 x 11 
%%% paper, we need:
%%% 1'' + \topmargin + \headheight + \headsep + \textheight + \footskip
%%% = 10.5in 
%%% Mess with \textheight and \footskip to change the size of the
%%% body of the page and the distance from the last baseline to the
%%% baseline of the footline. To move the whole shebang up, using
%%% \voffset is probably safest.
\setlength{\voffset}{0pt}
\setlength{\topmargin}{0pt}
\setlength{\headheight}{0pt}
\setlength{\headsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\textheight}{9in}
\setlength{\footskip}{.5in}

%%% \hoffset is the horizontal analog of \voffset, positive to shift right,
%%% negative to shift left
%%%
%%% \oddsidemargin is the left hand margin minus 1'' on odd numbered
%%% pages.
%%% \evensidemargin is the left hand margin minus 1'' on even numbered
%%% pages. 
%%%
%%% \textwidth is the width of the body of the text on the page.
\setlength{\hoffset}{0pt}
\setlength{\evensidemargin}{0pt}
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{0pt}
\setlength{\textwidth}{6.5in}

%%% This changes the standard line breaking penalties back to the plain TeX
%%% standard which is much less stringent than for AMS styles
\widowpenalty=150 
\clubpenalty=150
\brokenpenalty=100
\displaywidowpenalty=50

%%% ``Double'' spacing can be achieved by either of the following -- the
%%% LaTeX book recommends \baselinestretch and some online source says
%%% \linespread is to draconian.
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.66}
%\linespread{1.66}

%%% Half inch \parindent per TGS style ... this hurts....
\setlength{\parindent}{.5in}

%%% A feeble and probably futile attempt at adding some bonus interline glue
%%% to help reduce underfull hboxes when pages are typeset (jmd 6-11-2013)
\lineskip=1pt plus 1pt
\setlength{\parskip}{0pt plus 2pt}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
