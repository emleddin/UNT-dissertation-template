%%% The standard AMS math packages

%%% Choose REFERENCES or BIBLIOGRAPHY (Roughly speaking, choose "REFERENCES"

%%% Uncomment the following line and add the basename of the chapter file

\mainmatter

%%% This helps LaTeX to break a display across two pages in some
%%% circumstances. If it's commented out, the number of underful pages will
%%% probably go up (and the text will be distributed evenly on the
%%% underfilled pages, not pushed to the top).
\allowdisplaybreaks
  
%%% Include the chapters here.
\include{chapter1}
\include{chapter2}
%\include{chapter3}
%\include{chapter4}

%%% Uncomment if there are appendices. This command sets some things up in
%%% preparation for the actual appendices.
\appendix

%%% Include appendix "chapters" here. A single appendix should start with
%%% \appchapter*{TITLE} rather than \chapter{TITLE}. This supresses the 
%%% numbering (if there is only one appendix it doesn't rate a number). If
%%% there is more than one appendix, use \appchapter to get numbered
%%% appendices (A, B, C, ...).  
\include{appendix}

%%% This starts the backmatter, which so far is only the bibliography.
\backmatter

%%% This modifies some bits of the amsplain bibliography style to conform
%%% with UNT/TGS requirements.
\bibliographystyle{UNTamsplain}

%%% Include the .bib file containing the bibliographic information (in
%%% BiBTeX format...). ``bibliography.bib'' is a descriptive name for a
%%% bibliography file in BiBTeX format.
\bibliography{bibliography}
